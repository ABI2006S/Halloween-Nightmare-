### Project Demo
# Video
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OBRQ51FIms7IjaSEMYK-V0a5pO9krDxV/view?usp=drivesdk
*Explain what the video demonstrates*
the video indicates about the project mentioned above ...
clicking the link of website . The landing page should be an old 3d shaped rockbuilding with only one door ... The building can be creative and aesthetic in different ways. .. should give an old texture... The site should give an interactive texture on mouse clicks... On clicking the first door ... The door should open showing the inner room with 2 other doors ... The inner room should be creative and give an old texture with rocks..balcony on the side , old tv with some cracks , a broken aquarium .. should be arranged in a creative way .. a pair of old chairs and the 2 other doors as I mentioned earlier.. one should be on the left and one should be on the right ... Should show some animation like , some mosquitos or bees flying across the room, the room should get a lighting in an old way .. the lighting should give a spooky feel , or give a low light texture ...the doors should be detailed i mean some walking spiders on the web to the doors ... Etc and when the doors open show the spider webs shrinking ... These detailings are enough for the inner room ... On clicking either of the doors it should move to the 3rd room which gives more spooky feel with 3 doors ... 
The detailing should be the same as I mentioned earlier but on this one the lighting should be different .. a flickering light setup which gives totally a horror feel .. and the 3rd room should contain a skeliton in the corner , should contain all other details as I mentioned earlier.. Now on clicking any of the 3 doors this will move to the 1st door setup... Which means this is a loop and no going back is there and at last a dialogue " You are ripped "
